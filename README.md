**Project Description**
This is an entertainment app based on the old childhood game of Mad-libs. The game originally called for a person to give random words, such as adjectives, nouns, or verbs, and those words would be placed into a pre-chosen sentence or story for a humorous result. This app is similar to that game, but the words chosen (adjectives, nouns, or verbs) are selected from Urban Dictionary and placed into a randomly selected sentence.

The random sentences are hard coded and pulled from the mlab database at random. The words that were chosen from the Urban Dictionary are also hard coded because the dictionary's api is not set up to identify words by adjective, noun, or verb. (This also allowed us to filter less offensive words). The definitions of the selected words are pulled from Urban Dictionary's api.
